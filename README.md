# ChainPilot: Navigating Blockchain Data with Precision

ChainPilot is a Rust-based data analysis and processing tool designed to provide developers and researchers with a robust and efficient way to interact with blockchain data. It aims to simplify the complexities of blockchain data retrieval, transformation, and analysis, allowing users to focus on extracting valuable insights and building innovative applications. This project emphasizes performance, scalability, and a modular architecture, enabling it to adapt to various blockchain networks and data analysis requirements.

ChainPilot addresses the increasing need for specialized tools that can handle the massive and complex datasets generated by blockchain technology. Instead of relying on generic database solutions or manually parsing raw blockchain data, ChainPilot provides a structured and programmatic interface for accessing and manipulating this information. It achieves this through a combination of custom data structures, optimized data retrieval techniques, and a flexible plugin system. The core functionality includes efficient indexing, filtering, and aggregation of blockchain data, empowering users to perform tasks such as identifying transaction patterns, analyzing network activity, and monitoring smart contract behavior.

The primary benefit of using ChainPilot is the significant reduction in development time and resources required for blockchain data analysis. The pre-built modules and clear API allow developers to quickly integrate blockchain data into their applications without needing to build everything from scratch. Furthermore, the Rust implementation ensures high performance and memory safety, crucial for handling the large volumes of data associated with blockchain networks. ChainPilot's modular design also allows for easy extension and customization, enabling users to tailor the tool to their specific needs and research objectives. By providing a comprehensive and reliable platform for blockchain data analysis, ChainPilot aims to foster innovation and drive the adoption of blockchain technology across various industries.

## Key Features

*   **Efficient Data Indexing:** ChainPilot utilizes a custom indexing mechanism based on a combination of B-trees and hash tables to provide fast and efficient lookup of blockchain data. This allows for quick retrieval of specific transactions, blocks, or accounts based on various criteria, such as block height, transaction hash, or sender/receiver addresses. The indexing system is designed to be adaptable to different blockchain architectures and can be configured to index specific data fields based on the user's requirements.
*   **Flexible Data Filtering:** ChainPilot offers a powerful filtering engine that allows users to selectively extract relevant data from the blockchain. The filtering engine supports complex boolean expressions, numerical comparisons, and string matching, enabling users to define precise criteria for data selection. Filters can be applied at various stages of the data processing pipeline, allowing for fine-grained control over the data that is analyzed.
*   **Real-Time Data Streaming:** The tool supports real-time data streaming from blockchain networks using a pub-sub architecture. This allows users to continuously monitor blockchain activity and react to events in real-time. The data streaming module is designed to be resilient to network disruptions and ensures that no data is lost during the streaming process.
*   **Customizable Data Aggregation:** ChainPilot provides a flexible aggregation framework that allows users to perform custom calculations and summaries on blockchain data. The framework supports a wide range of aggregation functions, such as sum, average, count, min, and max, and allows users to define custom aggregation functions using Rust. The aggregation framework is designed to be efficient and scalable, enabling users to process large volumes of data quickly.
*   **Modular Plugin Architecture:** ChainPilot features a modular plugin architecture that allows users to extend the tool's functionality with custom modules. Plugins can be used to add support for new blockchain networks, implement custom data analysis algorithms, or integrate with external systems. The plugin architecture is designed to be easy to use and allows developers to quickly create and deploy custom plugins.
*   **Asynchronous Processing:** ChainPilot utilizes asynchronous programming techniques to maximize performance and throughput. This allows the tool to handle multiple tasks concurrently and avoid blocking operations, resulting in faster processing times and improved responsiveness. The asynchronous processing model is designed to be efficient and scalable, allowing the tool to handle large volumes of data without performance degradation.
*   **Comprehensive Error Handling and Logging:** ChainPilot includes a robust error handling and logging system that provides detailed information about any errors that occur during data processing. This allows users to quickly identify and resolve issues, ensuring the reliability and stability of the tool. The logging system can be configured to log different levels of information, allowing users to customize the level of detail that is logged.

## Technology Stack

*   **Rust:** The core programming language, chosen for its performance, memory safety, and concurrency features.
*   **tokio:** An asynchronous runtime for Rust, used for handling concurrent operations and network communication.
*   **rocksdb:** An embedded key-value store used for efficient data indexing and storage.
*   **serde:** A serialization/deserialization framework for Rust, used for handling data in various formats.
*   **clap:** A command-line argument parser for Rust, used for defining the tool's command-line interface.
*   **log & env_logger:** Logging libraries for Rust, used for providing detailed logging information.

## Installation

1.  **Install Rust:** If you don't have Rust installed, download and install it from [https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install). Ensure that you have `cargo` installed as well.
2.  **Clone the Repository:**
    git clone https://github.com/jjfhwang/ChainPilot.git
    cd ChainPilot
3.  **Build the Project:**
    cargo build --release
    This command will compile the project in release mode, optimizing it for performance. The compiled binary will be located in the `target/release` directory.

## Configuration

ChainPilot can be configured using environment variables. Here's a list of the configurable variables:

*   `CHAINPILOT_DATA_DIR`: Specifies the directory where ChainPilot will store its data. Defaults to `./data`.
*   `CHAINPILOT_LOG_LEVEL`: Sets the logging level. Possible values are `error`, `warn`, `info`, `debug`, and `trace`. Defaults to `info`.
*   `CHAINPILOT_NETWORK`: Specifies the blockchain network to connect to (e.g., `ethereum`, `bitcoin`). Defaults to `ethereum`.
*   `CHAINPILOT_RPC_URL`: The URL of the RPC endpoint for the blockchain network. This is required for connecting to the network and retrieving data. Example: `http://localhost:8545`.

To set these environment variables, you can use the following commands (example for Linux/macOS):
export CHAINPILOT_DATA_DIR=/path/to/data
export CHAINPILOT_LOG_LEVEL=debug
export CHAINPILOT_NETWORK=bitcoin
export CHAINPILOT_RPC_URL=http://localhost:8332

Or set them directly before running the binary:
CHAINPILOT_DATA_DIR=/path/to/data CHAINPILOT_LOG_LEVEL=debug ./target/release/chainpilot

## Usage

To run ChainPilot, navigate to the `target/release` directory and execute the compiled binary. ChainPilot provides various subcommands for different tasks.

For example, to start indexing blockchain data:
./target/release/chainpilot index --start-block 1000 --end-block 2000

To query specific transactions:
./target/release/chainpilot query --address 0x... --limit 10

Detailed API documentation for each subcommand and its options will be provided in a separate document. The `chainpilot --help` command will list all available commands and options.
The command line interface is designed for easy usage and supports features like autocompletion and detailed error messages.
